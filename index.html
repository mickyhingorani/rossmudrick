                        <p>One of my clients just has too many brilliant people working for them. Yes, that really is a problem. Each person brings a perspective that is too valuable to be left out of a grant proposal but, when I was brought in, the process had become messy and the voice of written materials had become mangled.</p>

                        <p>As a neutral arbiter, I am able to pick out the insights from each individual's story that are truly meaningful, and shape each of these elements into a cohesive narrative that is concise without sacrificing nuance.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Sometimes Less is More</h3>
                        <p>I got a call from a now-client who had just finished some distressing math. Having a full time staff member on foundation and corporate giving just didn't make sense, given the return on resources, but program staff took great professional satisfaction from having pots of money with which to be creative and reach new constituencies.</p>

                        <p>By focusing on the easy money, while working with staff to build a pipeline of experimental activities that are also highly fundable, I have maintained steady grant revenue at 40% of the staffing cost, and staff members are more excited than ever about potential new directions for their work.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Just the tough stuff</h3>
                        <p>For a client transitioning from a mom and pop shop to a professionalized organization, I secured a grant from their local community foundation to develop administrative infrastructure. Every step of the way, I walked them through what I was doing and why, to prepare them for future applications.</p>

                        <p>Now, they can do their own foundation research and relationship development, and they only have to bring me in for the pieces that involve strategy or writing. It's win-win for an organization where resources are tight; they save money by limiting my involvement to only those elements that require my specific skill set, and I get to work on the meaty stuff that gets my neurons firing.</p>
